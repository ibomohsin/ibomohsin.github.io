## About me

**ML research scientist** @ [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/) in Zurich. 

Welcome to my page! I am a research scientist at [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/), developing tools for understanding deep learning and improving its societal impact, particularly relating to fairness.
